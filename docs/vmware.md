# VMWare 

VMware Workstation is a program that allows you to run a virtual computer within your physical computer. The virtual computer runs as if it was its own machine. A virtual machine is great for trying out new operating systems such as Linux, visiting websites you don't trust, creating a computing environment specifically for children, testing the effects of computer viruses, and much more. You can even print and plug in USB drives. Read this guide to get the most out of VMware Workstation.

# Installing VMware Workstation

**1. Make sure your computer meets the system requirements.** Because you will be running an operating system from within your own operating system, VMware Workstation has fairly high system requirements. If you don’t meet these, you may not be able to run VMware effectively.
You must have a 64-bit processor.
VMware supports Windows and Linux operating systems.
You must have enough memory to run your operating system, the virtual operating system, and any programs inside that operating system. 1 GB is the minimum, but 3 or more is recommended.
You must have a 16-bit or 32-bit display adapter. 3D effects will most likely not work well inside the virtual operating system, so gaming is not always efficient.
You need at least 1.5 GB of free space to install VMware Workstation, along with at least 1 GB per operating system that you install.

**1. Open VMware.** Installing a virtual operating system is much like installing it on a regular PC. You will need to have the installation disc or ISO image as well as any necessary licenses for the operating system that you want to install.

* You can install most distributions of Linux as well as any version of Windows.

![](http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/2/23/Use-VMware-Workstation-Step-5-Version-3.jpg/aid1394826-v4-728px-Use-VMware-Workstation-Step-5-Version-3.jpg.webp)

**2. Click File.** Select New Virtual Machine and then choose Typical. VMware will prompt you for the installation media. If it recognizes the operating system, it will enable Easy Installation:

* *Physical disc* – Insert the installation disc for the operating system you want to install and then select the drive in VMware.
* *ISO image* – Browse to the location of the ISO file on your computer.
* *Install operating system later*. This will create a blank virtual disk. You will need to manually install the operating system later.

**4. Name your virtual machine.** The name will help you identify it on your physical computer. It will also help distinguish between multiple virtual computers running different operating systems.

![](http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/4/4d/Use-VMware-Workstation-Step-8-Version-3.jpg/aid1394826-v4-728px-Use-VMware-Workstation-Step-8-Version-3.jpg.webp)

**5. Set the disk size.** You can allocate any amount of free space on your computer to the virtual machine to act as the installed operating system’s hard drive. Make sure to set enough to install any programs that you want to run in the virtual machine.

![](http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/f/f7/Use-VMware-Workstation-Step-9-Version-3.jpg/aid1394826-v4-728px-Use-VMware-Workstation-Step-9-Version-3.jpg.webp)

**6. Customize your virtual machine’s virtual hardware.** You can set the virtual machine to emulate specific hardware by clicking the “Customize Hardware” button. This can be useful if you are trying to run an older program that only supports certain hardware. Setting this is optional.

![](http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/8/8d/Use-VMware-Workstation-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/aid1394826-v4-728px-Use-VMware-Workstation-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

**7. Set the virtual machine to start.** Check the box labeled “Power on this virtual machine after creation” if you want the virtual machine to start up as soon as you finish making it. If you don’t check this box, you can select your virtual machine from the list in VMware and click the Power On button.

**2. Stop a virtual machine.** To stop a virtual machine, select it and then click the VM menu. Select the Power option.

* *Power Off* – The virtual machine turns off as if the power was cut out.
* *Shut Down Guest* – This sends a shutdown signal to the virtual machine which causes the virtual machine to shut down as if you had selected the shutdown option.
* You can also turn off the virtual machine by using the shutdown option in the virtual operating system.

![](http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/3/3f/Use-VMware-Workstation-Step-15-Version-2.jpg/aid1394826-v4-728px-Use-VMware-Workstation-Step-15-Version-2.jpg.webp)

**3. Move files between the virtual machine and your physical computer.** Moving files between your computer and the virtual machine is as simple as dragging and dropping. Files can be moved in both directions between the computer and the virtual machine, and can also be dragged from one virtual machine to another.

* When you drag and drop, the original will stay in the original location and a copy will be created in the new location.
* You can also move files by copying and pasting.
* Virtual machines can connect to shared folders as well.
